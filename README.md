###Description:

To build an application that will run using [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/). Using Cordova we are able to have the application run on multiple **Andriod** devices without having to code for each individual device.

###Instructions:

To use the application type any item you need to purchase into the **Enter new item** feild at the bottom of the screen. Then click the **Add to List** button. If you would like to mark an item as purchased simply click on the item. If you would like to delete an item from the list click on the x button, which is on the right hand side of each list item.
